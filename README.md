# SONAR-ROCK-AND-MINE-PREDICTION

## OBJECTIVE
A machine learning project that has the potential to revolutionize submarine warfare. The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable system for differentiating between rocks and mines in submarine environments.
The importance of this project cannot be overstated. Misidentification of rocks as mines can have catastrophic consequences, putting submarines and their crews at risk. By developing a machine learning solution to this challenge, we hope to significantly reduce the risk of accidents and improve the safety of submarines around the world.

## THE PROBLEM

Differentiating between rocks and mines in submarine environments is an incredibly difficult task. The underwater terrain is often cluttered with rocks and other debris, making it challenging to distinguish between natural formations and man-made objects. This is further complicated by the fact that mines can be designed to look like rocks, making them even harder to detect.
Misidentification of rocks as mines can have serious consequences. It can lead to accidental detonation of mines, which can cause significant damage to submarines and put their crews at risk. Therefore, it is crucial that we find a way to accurately identify mines in submarine environments.

## CONCLUSION
 Rock vs mine prediction is a critical task for naval operations, and accurate prediction models are essential for improving the safety and effectiveness of these operations. By using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest we can develop models that can accurately differentiate between  rocks and mines.
Our experiments have shown that logistic regression models can achieve high levels of accuracy in rock vs mine prediction, demonstrating the potential of machine learning for improving underwater object detection and removal. We hope that our work will inspire further research in this area and lead to even more accurate and effective prediction models.
